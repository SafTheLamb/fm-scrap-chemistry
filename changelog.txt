Version: 0.5.3
Date: 2025-12-20
  Changes:
    - Move tar synthesis to chemistry-or-cryogenics instead of chemistry-or-organic (it's synthetic tar, not organic)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.2
Date: 2025-12-20
  Balancing:
    - Make butane the primary result from basic oil processing, followed by sour gas, then petroleum gas (used to be petroleum gas -> butane -> sour gas)
    - Specifically: 45 -> 20 petroleum gas, 25 -> 35 sour gas, 40 -> 45 butane
    - Add sour gas to the results from butane cracking (or petroleum gas cracking, if butane realism is disabled)
  Changes:
    - Move "methane from carbon" from space recipes to the fluid recipes category
    - Butane pollution: Replace Sour gas byproduct with more Butane
    - Butane cracking and synthetic tar can now be crafted in the biochamber
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 2025-12-08
  Changes:
    - Added fuel value to Butane and adjusted other fuel values (balanced around Gas Boiler)
  Compatibility:
    - AAI Industry: Potential compatibility fix via hidden dependency
    - I wasn't able to reproduce it locally, but this theoretically could happen if the load order was set up differently with more mods in the mix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2025-12-02
  Major Features:
    - Scrappy Industry is no longer required! The new Scrap Toolkit dependency handles all the complicated logic required
  Bugfixes:
    - Changed the recipe for Methane to require coal instead of light oil... because you can't get light oil yet... derp
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 2025-11-30
  Compatibility:
    - Hard Vulcanus: Force disable the coal liquefaction nerf setting, since it breaks Scrappy Chemistry (approved by thesixthroc)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 2025-11-29
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed butane cracking not being added to the technology
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2025-11-28
  Changes:
    - Shuffled fluidbox indices for oil refinery recipes around to reduce the amount of differences between them
    - Butane is now cracked into petroleum gas, instead of the other way around (can be disabled)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-11-26
  Major Features:
    - Added Methane, a new gas used to make more volatile chemical materials
    - [space-age] Added Hydrazine, made from Ammonia and used on Aquilo for high-energy recipes
  Minor Features:
    - Added Sour gas pollution, which uses Butane and Solid fuel to produce Light oil and Sulfur
    - [space-age] Added a recipe to make Methane from Carbon and Water
    - [space-age] Add a setting to change Thruster fuel to be crafted with Methane instead of Carbon
    - [space-age] Sulfuric acid geysers on Vulcanus now yield sour gas when "Modify sulfur" is enabled
  Compatibility:
    - [space-age] Any Planet Start: Compatibility for Vulcanus, Fulgora, and Gleba has been added
  Graphics:
    - Updated the sour gas icon to make it more distinct from the vanilla steam icon
    - Add machine tint to rocket fuel recipe
  Changes:
    - [space-age] Sour gas sweetening now uses Calcite to produce Sulfuric acid
    - [space-age] Thruster fuel is now produced with Methane instead of Carbon (can be disabled)
    - [space-age] Simple coal liquefaction has been changed to produce petroleum gas instead of heavy oil
    - Coal liquefaction has been changed to produce light oil instead of heavy oil
    - Tar liquefaction has been changed to produce heavy oil instead of crude oil
    - Explosives now use methane instead of petroleum gas and water
    - Removed tar from refined concrete recipe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-11-23
  Major Features:
    - Rocket fuel now costs petroleum gas instead of tar (can be disabled).
    - Rocket fuel is now crafted in the chemical plant (can be disabled).
    - Explosives now cost petroleum gas, and cost coal again instead of tar.
    - Sulfur can no longer be crafted from petroleum gas by default (can be disabled).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2025-11-23
  Major Features:
    - Added recipe to produce sulfur from sour gas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
  Major Features:
    - Initial release.
